# IRIS-Flower
This projects irisprojectDecisionTreeClassifiermodel.py,irisprojectkNeighboursClassifiermodel.py, irisprojectLogisticRegressionmodel.py, irisprojectRandomForestClassifiermodel.py and irisprojectsupportvectorMachinemodel.py are about various Linear Regression models to determine the species of the an Iris flower given its dimensions.

The project irisproject2.0 combines these models to find out the most accurate model and predicts the results according to the that model. The Python GUI helps to navigate through the various models i.e. see their accuracy and their prediction. It also helps to compare the various models and see their results side by side by using a bar graph
